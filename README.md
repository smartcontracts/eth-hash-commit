# Ethereum Hash Commitments

This is an extremely minimal website for making hash commitments on-chain.
It uses no external dependencies other than requiring that `window.ethereum` exist in the global page scope.
You can access a deployment of this code at [hash.ethcatalog.org](https://hash.ethcatalog.org).
It's not very pretty.
